title: "Trivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.


```{r}
ggplot(holiday_movies, aes(x = average_rating, fill = title_type)) +
  geom_bar()+
   labs(
    title = "Title type's and their"~italic("Ratings"),
    caption = "Created by Isaiah",
    x = "rating",
    y = "Title type totals")+
  scale_fill_viridis_d()    
   
  
  
```
```{r}
ggplot(holiday_movies, aes(y = average_rating, x = runtime_minutes, color = title_type)) +  
geom_point() +
geom_smooth(se = FALSE,method = "lm")+
  labs(
    title = "Length of movies compared to"~italic("Rating"),
    caption = "Created by Isaiah",
    x = "Movie length",
    y = "rating")+
  scale_fill_viridis_d()
