Use this file to generate a professional looking **bivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(mosaic)
data("Birthdays")
head(Birthdays)
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(Birthdays, aes(x = date, y = births)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Births over the years",
       caption = "Created by Isaiah")
```

```{r}
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-12-12')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 50)

holiday_movies <- tuesdata$holiday_movies
holiday_movie_genres <- tuesdata$holiday_movie_genres

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

holiday_movies <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-12-12/holiday_movies.csv')
holiday_movie_genres <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2023/2023-12-12/holiday_movie_genres.csv')
```


```{r}
ggplot(holiday_movies , aes( x = year, y = runtime_minutes)) +
geom_line()+
   labs(
    title = "Length of movies over"~italic("Time"),
    caption = "Created by Isaiah", 
    x = "Year",
    y = "Movie length")  
  
```
