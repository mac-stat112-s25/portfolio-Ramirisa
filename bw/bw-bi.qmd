Use this file to generate a professional looking **bivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
ggplot(Birthdays, aes(x = date, y = births)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Births over the years",
       caption = "Created by Isaiah")
```
```{r}
ggplot(holiday_movies , aes( x = year, y = runtime_minutes)) +
geom_line()+
   labs(
    title = "Length of movies over"~italic("Time"),
    caption = "Created by Isaiah", 
    x = "Year",
    y = "Movie length")  
  
```
