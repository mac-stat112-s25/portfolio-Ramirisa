title: "Univariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package 
## install.packages("tidytuesdayR")

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-06-04')
## OR
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2024, week = 23)

cheeses <- tuesdata$cheeses

# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub

cheeses <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-06-04/cheeses.csv')
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cheeses, aes(x = vegetarian))+
geom_bar(color = "darkblue", fill = "lightblue")  +
  labs(x = "Cheese is vegetarian",
       title = "Vegan vs. Non Vegan cheese",
       caption = "Created by Isaiah")
```
