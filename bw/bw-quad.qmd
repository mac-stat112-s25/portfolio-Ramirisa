title: "Quadvariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **quadvariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(leaflet)

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  
  addCircleMarkers(
    data = favorite_Places,
    lng = ~long, lat = ~lat,
    color = ~ifelse(favorite == "yes", "red", "darkblue"),
    radius = ~ifelse(favorite == "yes", 6, 4), 
    label = ~place,  # Adds hover labels
    labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = FALSE, direction = "auto")
  ) %>%
  setView(lng = mean(favorite_Places$long), lat = mean(favorite_Places$lat), zoom = 6)
  


```

```{r}
ggplot(holiday_movies, aes(y = average_rating, x = year, color = title_type, shape = christmas )) +
  geom_point()+
  labs(title = "Movie success based on categories",
       caption = "Created by Isaiah")
       
```
