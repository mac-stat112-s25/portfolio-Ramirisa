title: "Spatial Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **spatial** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
starbucks_us <- starbucks |> 
  filter(Country == "US")


ggplot(starbucks_with_2018_pop_est, aes(map_id = state_name, fill = starbucks_per_10000)) +
  geom_map(map = states_map) +
  geom_point(
    data = starbucks_us,
    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),
    size = 0.05,
    alpha = 0.2,
    color = "orange", 
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  ) +
  expand_limits(x = states_map$long, y = states_map$lat) +
   
  labs(
    title = "Starbucks Density Across the United States",
    caption = "Created by Isaiah")+
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = 'Starbucks per 10000' , colors = c("blue", "lightblue"), values = scales::rescale(seq(0, 100, by = 5)))
 
   
 
        
```



```{r}

library(leaflet)

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  
  addCircleMarkers(
    data = favorite_Places,
    lng = ~long, lat = ~lat,
    color = ~ifelse(favorite == "yes", "red", "darkblue"),
    radius = ~ifelse(favorite == "yes", 6, 4), 
    label = ~place,  # Adds hover labels
    labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = FALSE, direction = "auto")
  ) %>%
  setView(lng = mean(favorite_Places$long), lat = mean(favorite_Places$lat), zoom = 6)

```
